# software shinobi linux

I always wanted a custom build of Linux to call my own. This is that but dockerized and very incomplete. 

```bash

git clone https://github.com/software-shinobi/software-shinobi-linux.git

cd software-shinobi-linux

docker-compose build

docker-compose up

```




  450  ls
  451  docker-compose build
  452  docker-compose up -d
  453  docker ps
  454  history
  455  ssh -p 2222 developer@localhost
  456  ssh-keygen -f "/home/software-shinobi/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "[localhost]:2222"
  457  ssh -p 2222 developer@localhost
  458  history
